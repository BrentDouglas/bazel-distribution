Want to contribute? Your contribution is warmly welcomed! Please be aware of the following caveats:

### Large contributions

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with us first to
explain your idea so we can help and possibly guide you, which you can do using:

- The GitHub issue tracker;
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/typedb).

If you don't do this, large contributions are unlikely to be reviewed.

### Code reviews and other contributions.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.
